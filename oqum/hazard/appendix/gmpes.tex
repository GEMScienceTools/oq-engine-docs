    earthquakes in active tectonic regions developed using data from the 
    Turkish strong-motion database. Equations are valid for a distance 
    %(\gls{acr:rjb}) range of 0–200 km and are derived for moment magnitudes 
    range of 0–200 km and are derived for moment magnitudes 
    between 5 and 7.6.
