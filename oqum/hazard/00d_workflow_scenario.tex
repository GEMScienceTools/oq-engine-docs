In case of \gls{acr:ssha}, the input data consist of a single earthquake
rupture model and one or more ground-motion models. Using the Ground Motion
Field Calculator, multiple realizations of ground shaking can be computed,
each realization sampling the aleatory uncertainties in the ground-motion
model.

The main calculators used to perform this analysis are:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \emph{Ground Motion Field Calculator}

    The Ground Motion Field Calculator was already introduced during the
	description of the event based PSHA workflow (see
	Section~\ref{subsec:event_based_psha} at
	page~\pageref{subsec:event_based_psha}).
