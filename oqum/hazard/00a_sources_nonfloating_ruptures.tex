\subsubsection{Characteristic faults}

The characteristic fault source is a particular typology of fault created
with the assumption that its ruptures will always cover the entire fault
surface. As such, no floating is necessary on the surface. The characteristic fault may still take as input a magnitude frequency distribution. In this case, the fault surface can be represented either as a \gls{simplefaultsource} surface or as a \gls{complexfaultsource} surface or as a combination of rectangular ruptures as represented in
Figure~\ref{fig:char_fault_source}. Mutiple surfaces containing mixed geometry types are also supported.

\paragraph{Source data}

\begin{itemize}

    \item The characteristic rupture surface is defined through one of the
    following options:

        \begin{itemize}

            \item A list of rectangular ruptures (``planar surfaces'')

            \item A \gls{simplefaultsource} geometry

            \item A \gls{complexfaultsource} geometry

        \end{itemize}

    \item A \gls{frequencymagnitudedistribution}.

    \item Rake angle (specified following the Aki-Richards convention; see
          \citet{aki2002}).

    \item Upper and lower depth values limiting the seismogenic interval.

\end{itemize}
A comprehensive example enumerating the possible rupture surface configurations is shown below.

\subsubsection{Non-Parametric Fault}
\label{desc_nonparametric_fault}
\index{Source type!fault!nonparametric}
\index{Non-Parametric fault|see{Source type}}

The non-parametric fault typology requires that the user indicates the rupture properties (rupture surface, magnitude, rake and hypocentre) and the corresponding probabilities of the rupture. The probabilities are given as a list of floating point values that correspond to the probabilities of $0, 1, 2, \ldots ... N$ occurrences of the rupture within the specified investigation time. Note that there is not, at present, any internal check to ensure that the investigation time to which the probabilities refer corresponds to that specified in the configuration file. As the surface of the rupture is set explicitly, no rupture floating occurs, and, as in the case of the characteristic fault source, the rupture surface can be defined as either a single planar rupture, a list of planar ruptures, a \gls{simplefaultsource} geometry, a \gls{complexfaultsource} geometry, or a combination of different geometries.

An comprehensive example enumerating the possible configurations is shown below:
