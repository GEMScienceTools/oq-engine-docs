The \glsdesc{acr:oqe} output of a disaggregation analysis corresponds to the
combination of a hazard curve and a multidimensional matrix containing the
results of the disaggregation.

The example below shows the list of disaggregation results obtained for four
logic tree realisations.

For each realisation, disaggregation has been completed for two intensity
measure levels corresponding to different probabilities of exceedence in the
specified \texttt{investigation time}.

In the following inset we show an example of the nrml file used to represent
the different disaggregation matrices (highlighted in red) produced by
\gls{acr:oqe}:
