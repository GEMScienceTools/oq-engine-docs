The \glsdesc{acr:oqe} output of a disaggregation analysis corresponds to the
combination of a hazard curve and a multidimensional matrix containing the
results of the disaggregation.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ oq engine --lo <calc_id>
id | output_type | name

4  | datastore | realizations

Running \texttt{-{}-export-output} to export the disaggregation results will produce individual files for each IMT, probability of exceedence and logic tree realisation. In the following inset we show an example of the nrml file used to represent the different disaggregation matrices (highlighted in red) produced by
\gls{acr:oqe}:
