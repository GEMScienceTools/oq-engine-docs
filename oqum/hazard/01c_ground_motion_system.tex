The Ground Motion System defines the models and the possible epistemic
uncertainties related to ground motion modelling to be incorporated into the
calculation.

\subsection{The Ground Motion Logic Tree}
\index{Input!Ground motion logic tree}
\label{subsec:gmlt}

The structure of the \gls{groundmotionlogictree} consists of a list of ground
motion prediction equations for each tectonic region used to characterise the
sources in the PSHA input model.

The example below shows a simple \gls{groundmotionlogictree}. This logic tree
assumes that all the sources in the PSHA input model belong to ``Active
Shallow Crust'' and uses for calculation the \citet{chiou2008}
\gls{acr:gmpe}.
