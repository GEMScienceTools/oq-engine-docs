\section{Running OpenQuake-engine for hazard calculations}
\index{Running OpenQuake!hazard} 
The execution of a hazard analysis using the OpenQuake-engine 
is straightforward. Below we provide an example of the simplest 
command that can be used to launch a hazard calculation which 
consists in the invocation of \texttt{openquake} together with 
the \texttt{--rh} option which stands for ``run hazard'' and 
the name of a configuration file (in the example below
it corresponds to \texttt{job.ini}):
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ openquake --rh job.ini
\end{Verbatim}

The amount of information prompted during the execution of the 
analysis is controlled by means of the \texttt{--log-level} flag 
as shown in the example below:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ openquake --rh job.ini --log-level debug
\end{Verbatim}
In this example we ask the engine to provide an extensive amount
of information (usually not justified for a standard analysis). 
Alternative options are: \texttt{debug}, \texttt{info}, \texttt{progress},
\texttt{warn}, \texttt{error}, \texttt{critical}.

There are two alterative ways to get results from OpenQuake engine:
directly at the end of the calculation, by exporting them from the 
internal \gls{acr:oqe} database. 

The first option is activated at the OpenQuake invocation by the flag 
\texttt{--exports xml} as shown in the example below
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ openquake --rh job.ini \textcolor{red}{--exports xml}
\end{Verbatim}
The second option, allows the user to export the computed results at 
their's disposal.

The list of the hazard calculations stored on the \gls{acr:oqe} is 
obtained with the following command:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ openquake --lhc
\end{Verbatim}
The execution of this command will produce a list of the hazard 
calculations performed with OpenQuake.
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ openquake --lhc
