In this Chapter we provide a desciption of the main commands available
for running hazard with the \gls{acr:oqe} and the file formats used to 
represent the results of the analyses.

A general introduction to the use of OpenQuake is provided in Section 
\ref{sec:intro} at page \pageref{sec:intro}.
The reader is invited to consult this part before moving into
the details of this section.

\section{Running OpenQuake-engine for hazard calculations}
\index{Running OpenQuake!hazard} 
The execution of a hazard analysis using the OpenQuake-engine 
is straightforward. Below we provide an example of the simplest 
command that can be used to launch a hazard calculation which 
consists in the invocation of \texttt{openquake} together with 
the \texttt{--rh} option which stands for ``run hazard'' and 
the name of a configuration file (in the example below
it corresponds to \texttt{job.ini}):
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ openquake --rh job.ini
\end{Verbatim}

The amount of information prompted during the execution of the 
analysis is controlled by means of the \texttt{--log-level} flag 
as shown in the example below:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ openquake --rh job.ini --log-level debug
\end{Verbatim}
In this example we ask the engine to provide an extensive amount
of information (usually not justified for a standard analysis). 
Alternative options are: \texttt{debug}, \texttt{info}, \texttt{progress},
\texttt{warn}, \texttt{error}, \texttt{critical}.

\subsection{Getting results}
There are two alternative ways to get results from the OpenQuake engine:
directly through the calculation or by exporting them from the 
internal \gls{acr:oqe} database once a calculation is completed. 

The first option is activated at the OpenQuake engine invocation by 
the flag \texttt{--exports xml} as shown in the example below
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ openquake --rh job.ini \textcolor{red}{--exports xml}
\end{Verbatim}

The second option, allows the user to export the computed results at 
their's disposal.
In order to get the list of results of the hazard calculations stored 
in the \gls{acr:oqe} database the user can utilize the following command:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ openquake --lhc
\end{Verbatim}
The execution of this command will produce a list similar to the 
one provided below.
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ openquake --lhc
calc_id | num_jobs | latest_job_status | last_update | description
1 | 1 | failed | 2013-03-01 09:49:34  | Classical PSHA
2 | 1 | successful | 2013-03-01 09:49:56  | Classical PSHA
3 | 1 | failed | 2013-03-01 10:24:04  | Classical PSHA
4 | 1 | failed | 2013-03-01 10:28:16  | Classical PSHA
5 | 1 | failed | 2013-03-01 10:30:04  | Classical PSHA
6 | 1 | successful | 2013-03-01 10:31:53  | Classical PSHA
7 | 1 | failed | 2013-03-09 08:15:14  | Classical PSHA
8 | 1 | successful | 2013-03-09 08:18:04  | Classical PSHA
\end{Verbatim}
Subsequently the user can get the list of result stored for a specific 
hazard analysis
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ openquake --lho <calc_id>
id | output_type | name
3 | hazard_curve | hc-rlz-6
\end{Verbatim}
and finally extract an xml file for a specific hazard result 
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ openquake --eh <result_id> <path_to_the_output_folder>
\end{Verbatim}
