The main components of a logic tree structure in the OpenQuake engine are 
the following:
\begin{description}
    \item[branch]: the simplest component of a logic tree structure. 
    A branch represent an alternative 
    \item[branching set]: it groups a set of branches i.e. 
    alternative interpretation of a parameter or a model. This set of 
    uncertainties can be applied to the whole initial seismic source input 
    model or to a subset of seismic source data. The sum of the 
    weights/probabilities assigned to the set of branches 
    \item[branching level]: it's the largest container. It's not used in 
    modelling uncertainty, but it's useful in maintaining a logic and an 
    order in the structure of the logic tree as it's will be explained in 
    the following examples.
