\section{OpenQuake-engine introduction}
\gls{acr:oqe} is the seismic hazard and risk calculation software developed 
by the Global Earthquake Model. By following current standards in software 
developments, like test-driven development and continuous
integration, OpenQuake-engine aims a becoming an open, and community-driven tool for
seismic hazard and risk analysis.

The source code of the OpenQuake-engine is available on a public web-based
repository at the following address: 
\href{http://github.com/gem/oq-engine}{http://github.com/gem/oq-engine}.

A schematic list of the options that can be used for the execution of the 
\gls{acr:oqe} can be obtained with the following command:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ oq-engine --help
\end{Verbatim}
The result is the following:
