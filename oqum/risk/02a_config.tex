\begin{itemize}

	\item \Verb+region_constraint+: this field is used to define the polygon
	enclosing the region of interest. Assets outside of this region will not
	be considered in the risk calculations. This region is defined using pairs
	of coordinates that indicate the vertices of the polygon. The list of
	points defining the polygon can be provided either in a clockwise or
	counter-clockwise direction. For each point, the longitude is listed first,
	followed by the latitude, both in decimal degrees.

	\item \Verb+asset_hazard_distance+: this parameter indicates the maximum
	allowable distance between an \gls{asset} and the closest hazard input.
	Hazard inputs can include hazard curves or ground motion intensity values.
	If no hazard input is found within this distance, the \gls{asset} is
	skipped and a message is provided mentioning the id of the asset that is
	affected by this issue. If this parameter is not provided, the
	OpenQuake-engine assumes the maximum allowable distance as 5 km.
