As previously explained, this calculator uses loss exceedance curves which are
calculated using the Classical PSHA-based Risk calculator. The
\Verb+calculation_mode+ should be set to \Verb+classical_bcr+ and the
calculator-specific part of the configuration file should be defined as
presented below.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, samepage=true]
...
structural_vulnerability_file = structural_vulnerability_model.xml
vulnerability_retrofitted_file = retrofitted_vulnerability_model.xml

lrem_steps_per_interval = 2

interest_rate = 0.05
asset_life_expectancy = 50
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item  \Verb+vulnerability_retrofitted_file+: this parameter is used to specify the path to the \gls{vulnerability model} file containing the \glspl{vulnerability function} for the retrofitted assets;
\item  \Verb+interest_rate+: this parameter represents the interest rate and it serves the purposes of taking into account the variation of building value throughout time;
\item  \Verb+asset_life_expectancy+: this variable defines the life expectancy, or design life, of the assets.
\end{itemize}
