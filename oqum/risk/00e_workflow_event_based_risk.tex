In this calculator, loss exceedance curves and loss maps for various return
periods can be calculated, based on probabilistic seismic hazard, with an
event-based approach. A large number of stochastic event sets are generated,
and the associated ground motion fields for each event are used together with
a vulnerability model to compute the individual (per asset) and total (sum of
all the losses per event) losses. Then, this distribution of losses is
employed to derive a loss exceedance curve per asset, as well as a total loss
exceedance curve representative of the complete building portfolio.
Furthermore, oq-risklib can also compute loss maps for various return periods
by interpolating each individual loss curve with the respective probability of
exceedance. In Figure~\ref{fig:io-structure-event-based-risk}, the
input/output scheme of this calculator is illustrated.
