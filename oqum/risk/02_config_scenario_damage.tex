For this calculator, the parameter \Verb+calculation_mode+ should be set to
\Verb+scenario_damage+. A minimal job configuration file required for
running a scenario damage calculation is shown below:

\inputminted[firstline=1,firstnumber=1,fontsize=\footnotesize,frame=single,linenos,bgcolor=lightgray]{ini}{oqum/risk/Verbatim/config_scenario_damage_minimal.ini}\\

\paragraph{Example 1}

This example illustrates an \gls{exposure model} in which the aggregated
cost (structural, nonstructural, contents and business interruption) of the
buildings of each taxonomy for a set of locations is directly provided. Thus,
in order to indicate how the various costs will be defined, the following
information needs to be stored in the exposure model file:

The above scenario damage calculation example can be run by providing the
OpenQuake-engine with the calculation id of the scenario hazard calculation,
the ground motion fields from which should be used for the scenario damage
calculation.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \Verb+structural_fragility_file+: a parameter used to define the path
	to the structural \gls{fragility model} file.
\end{itemize}
