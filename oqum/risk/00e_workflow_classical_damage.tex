The classical PSHA-based damage calculator convolves through numerical integration, the damage state fragility functions for an asset with the seismic hazard curve at the location of the asset. The main results of this calculator are damage distribution statistics for each asset, which describe the expected fraction of buildings in each damage state. Furthermore, a probabilistic collapse map can be extracted giving the probability of collapse for each asset within the specified time period. Damage distribution aggregated by taxonomy or of the total portfolio (considering all assets in the exposure model) can not be extracted using this calculator, as the spatial correlation of the ground motion residuals is not taken into consideration. The input and output files involved in this calculator are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:ClassicalDamage}.
