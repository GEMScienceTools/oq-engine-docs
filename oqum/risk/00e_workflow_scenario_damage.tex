This calculator is capable of assessing the damage distribution due to a
single scenario earthquake, for a collection of assets. Similarly to the
previous calculator, in order to perform the necessary risk calculations one
or a set of ground motion fields are required, which can be derived using the
oq-hazardlib, or introduced in the OpenQuake-engine using the appropriate NRML
schema. In this calculator, a fragility model is combined with the
distribution of ground motion at the location of each asset, to estimate the
number or area of buildings in each damage state. The damage distribution can
be extracted per asset, per building typology (taxonomy) or considering all of
the assets simultaneously (total damage distribution). In addition, this
calculator also provides collapse maps, which contain the spatial distribution
of the number or area of collapsed buildings throughout the region of
interest. The input/output structure for this calculator is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:io-structure-scenario-damage}.
