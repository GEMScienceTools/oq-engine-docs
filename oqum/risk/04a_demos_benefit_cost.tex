The loss exceedance curves used within this demo are produced using the Classical PSHA-based Risk calculator. Thus, the process to produce the seismic hazard curves described in the respective section (\ref{subsec:demos_classical_risk}) can be employed here. Then, the risk calculations can be initiated using the following command:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, samepage=true]
user@ubuntu:~\$ oq-engine --rr job_bcr.ini --hazard-output-id 27
\end{Verbatim}

which should produce the following output:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, samepage=true]
Calculation 17 results:
id | output_type | name
37 | bcr_distribution | BCR Distribution for hazard 27
\end{Verbatim}
