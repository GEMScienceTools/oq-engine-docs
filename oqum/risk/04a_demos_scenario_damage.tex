The same rupture described in the Scenario Risk demo was used for this demo.
The workflow to produce the set of ground motion fields described in the
previous section is also valid herein. Then, to run the Scenario Damage demo,
users should move to the folder where the required files have been placed and
employ following command:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, samepage=true]
user@ubuntu:~\$ oq-engine --run job_damage.ini --hazard-output-id 20
\end{Verbatim}

and the following outputs will be produced:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, samepage=true]
Calculation 12 results:
id | output_type | name
23 | collapse_map | Collapse Map per Asset
24 | dmg_dist_per_asset | Damage Distribution per Asset
25 | dmg_dist_per_taxonomy | Damage Distribution per Taxonomy
26 | dmg_dist_total | Damage Distribution Total
\end{Verbatim}
