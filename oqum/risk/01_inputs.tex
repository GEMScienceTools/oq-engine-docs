The following sections describe the basic inputs required for a risk
calculation, including exposure models, fragility models, consequence models,
and vulnerability models. In addition, each risk calculator also requires the
appropriate hazard inputs computed in the region of interest. Hazard inputs
include hazard curves for the classical probabilistic damage and risk
calculators, ground motion fields for the scenario damage and risk
calculators, or stochastic event sets for the probabilistic event based
calculators.
